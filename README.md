# EEG-and-Machine-Learning
Here in this project Concentration Level of the students is predicted during the performance of following different Tasks:
(i)Arithmetic Calculations. (ii)Reading Technical Articles. (iii)Listening to the Technical Podcasts. (iv)Reading Transcripts.
(v)Browsing the Internet and Relaxing with Open or closed Eyes.
The study aims to find the appropriate Machine Learning(ML) model that predicts
the concentration level through brain signal analysis. For this purpose,different ML classifiers are used for comparative analysis, namely:
Adaboost, Navie Bays, ANN, SVM and Decision Tree.
